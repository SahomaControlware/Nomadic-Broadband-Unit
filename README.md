# Nomadic-Broadband-Unit
With onboard power generation and fixed wireless or satellite internet receivers, the Nomadic Broadband Unit is an innovative solution to the lack of internet infrastructure in remote areas. This broadband unit is a towable, mobile platform developed through public/private partnerships in concert with Washington State University (WSU) Extension, Microsoft TechSpark and Airband teams, and the University of Washington (UW). The goal is to rapidly mobilize and provide broadband internet access in remote areas to support emergency or disaster response and recovery, with other ancillary and beneficial community uses, as well.
